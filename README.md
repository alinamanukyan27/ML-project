# ML-Titanic-project
A hands-on machine learning project demonstrating data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation within a single, well-structured Jupyter Notebook.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on applying machine learning techniques to a specific dataset. The goal is to explore, model, and evaluate performance using common ML methods.

## What’s Inside

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualizations for better insights  

## Getting Started

To run this notebook, you’ll need:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- Common libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline, from raw data to evaluated model. By walking through data exploration, preprocessing, and training, we gain hands-on insight into how ML models perform and how their results can be interpreted. Future improvements may include testing additional models, hyperparameter tuning, or applying this pipeline to new datasets.
